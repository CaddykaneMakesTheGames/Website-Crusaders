    <p class="normaltext">This website is actually a school project, at least for now, which probably explains why it looks so bad. As the creator of this website, I'm currently still learning how to code in HTML. (Give me a tip in the comments section if you find something out of the ordinary!) Me and my partner for this project both are making websites sprouted from our love for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and although he's making his own website, we've been sharing bits of code and he's been a big help! Anyways, yes, this website is only up because of a school project, but I'll probably still be working on it, even after it's over! Thanks for your support!</p>
