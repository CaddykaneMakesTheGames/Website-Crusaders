    <p class="normaltext">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (or in its Japanese name, JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken) is a long-running series of manga that has recently been adapted into an anime. The author of the manga, Hirohiko Araki, has written and illustrated 8 "parts" so far, with every part having a new protagonist and story, while the company behind the anime adaptation, David Productions, has animated 5 parts so far. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure itself, as the name suggests, is known for its strange character design, with many characters having very out-of-place clothing choices and personalities, which has become an inside joke in the community. However, these odd choices in style have actually paid off, resulting with Hirohiko Araki getting a <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Gucci_X_Hirohiko_Araki_X_Spur" style="color:gold">collaboration with Gucci itself (as well as a women's fashion magazine named Spur)</a>, due to the series' popularity in Asia. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has also collaborated with Vans, although both of these collaborations only sold their products in Japan, and could not ship to the West Coast.</p>
    <p class="normaltext">The first part of the series, titled <u>Phantom  Blood</u>, is about Jonathan Joestar, who learns a secret fighting technique from Will Zeppeli to defeat his adopted brother, Dio Brando, who becomes a vampire to kill Jonathan and his family. Jonathan and Zeppeli then befriend and team up with two other people: Robert E.O. Speedwagon, a criminal-turned-gentleman with a bladed hat, and Poco, a young boy whose sister was kidnapped by Dio.</p>  <p class="normaltext">The different parts then feature the descendants of Jonathan Joestar who fight all sorts of villains after that. The titles of each part and their protagonists are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="normaltext"><b style="color:gold">Jonathan Joestar</b>, the protagonist of Phantom Blood</li>
      <li class="normaltext"><b style="color:gold">Joseph Joestar</b>, the protagonist of Battle Tendency</li>
      <li class="normaltext"><b style="color:gold">Jotaro Kujo</b>, the protagonist of Stardust Crusaders</li>
      <li class="normaltext"><b style="color:gold">Josuke Higashikata</b>, the protagonist of Diamond is Unbreakable</li>
      <li class="normaltext"><b style="color:gold">Giorno Giovanna</b>, the protagonist of Golden Wind</li>
      <li class="normaltext"><b style="color:gold">Jolyne Kujo</b>, the protagonist of Stone Ocean and the first female protagonist</li>
      <li class="normaltext"><b style="color:gold">Johnny Joestar</b>, the protagonist of Steel Ball Run</li>
      <li class="normaltext"><b style="color:gold">Josuke Higashikata</b> (a different one, lovingly referred to as 'Gappy'), the protagonist of JoJolion, the most recent part.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normaltext">These characters all feature in different time periods and places, with Jonathan Joestar being in Victorian-era England, Joseph being in 1920s New York, and all the others after that being in the modern day and in places like Japan, Italy, and Florida, with the exception of Part 7's Johnny Joestar, whose story is set in the mid-1800s, between Jonathan and Joseph.</p>
